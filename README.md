# DIY Portrait-Mode Gamepad

![](images/gamepad_assembled.jpg)

## Overview

This RP2040-powered gamepad is designed for portrait-mode games. It plugs directly into a smartphone's USB-C port and is compatible with virtually any operating system. No Bluetooth connection or batteries are required as the gamepad communicates directly via USB and acts as a HID controller. The button layout is ideal for emulators, but the side buttons also enable landscape-mode gaming. The gamepad uses the fantasic [GP2040-CE](https://github.com/OpenStickCommunity/GP2040-CE) firmware, which also enables a local webserver Web-UI for configuration. Finally, all parts of the case and buttons are fully 3D-printable.
